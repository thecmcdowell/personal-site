# Personal Site
the main purpose of this website was to see how quickly I could make a decent looking responsive site relying (almost) entirely on BootStrap. 
The Projects section needs to be totally filled out, and there should be a profesional summery. 

## Word on hosting
This site is actually hosted in a google cloud bucket, as it's a completely static site.
